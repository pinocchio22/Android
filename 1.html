    <p>I will always remember
        The day you kissed my lips
        Light as a feather
        And it went just like this
        No, it's never been better
        Than the summer of 2002
        We were only eleven
        But acting like grownups
        Like we are in the present
        Drinking from plastic cups
        Singing love is forever and ever
        Well, I guess that was true</p>

    <p style="margin-top:10px;">Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
        On an old Mustang, where we sang
        Songs with all our childhoods friends
        And it went like this, say
        Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
        Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
        Better hit me, baby, one more time
        Paint a picture for you and me
        Of the days when we were young
        Singing at the top of both our lungs</p>
